This sample program is called Asciidraw. It prompts a user for a numeric password. If the password is correct, the user is presented with an image and a message proclaiming success. Otherwise, the user is presented a different image with a message implying failure.

Note: will need to specify public and private key names as parameters on the command line. In a future release, may add hardcode names into modified source by Proteus so there is no need.
